\title{Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm}
\usage{
smooth_chaikin(x, type = c("polygon", "line"), refinements = 4L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric matrix; 2-column matrix of coordinates.}

\item{type}{character; whether the coordinates correspond to a line or
polygon.}

\item{refinements}{integer; number of corner cutting iterations to apply.}
}
\value{
A matrix with the coordiantes of the smoothed curve.
}
\description{
Chaikin's corner cutting algorithm smooths a curve by iteratively replacing
every point by two new points: one 1/4 of the way to the next point and one
1/4 of the way to the previous point. This method results in a curve that
does not pass through the vertices of the original curve.
}
\details{
This function works on matrices of points and is generally not called
directly. Instead, use \code{\link[=smooth]{smooth()}} with \code{method = "chaikin"} to apply this
smoothing algorithm to spatial features.
